        <h2>Accessibility Prototypes</h2>

        <p>The PhET Interactive Simulations project is actively engaged in efforts to increase the accessibility of interactive simulations for
            diverse students, including students with disabilities. Our goal is to design, implement, research, and refine accessibility features for
            PhET simulations, and share our findings and insights with the broader educational technology community. As part of this work, we have
            developed prototypes of PhET simulations with preliminary implementations of accessibility features, e.g., simulations with keyboard
            navigation, or sonification. Below you will find links to some of the prototypes we have developed. As you explore these prototypes,
            please make note of the specific browser and assistive technology they were tested on.</p>

        <br/>

        <h2>Keyboard Navigation and Auditory Descriptions</h2>

        <p>At PhET Interactive Simulations, we are researching and investigating ways to provide keyboard and screen reader
            support to facilitate learning for students with visual or motor impairments. The simulations are rendered using
            SVG or Canvas (with WebGL support planned for the future) which makes it impossible to use conventional DOM-based
            approaches for accessibility. We have created the following prototypes as part of our research. These prototypes
            are known to have many issues and are not ready for broad usage.</p>

        <p>Below are prototypes of simulations containing implementations of keyboard navigation (allowing interactions without the use of a mouse or
            touch interface) and auditory descriptions (for screen readers).</p>

        <h2>Custom Support in Forces and Motion: Basics (Net Force Screen)</h2>

        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
                <td>This prototype is rendered with SVG and uses global key listeners to provide our own keyboard accessibility
                    support.
                    Focused elements are managed using custom data structures and the focus rectangle is drawn in SVG.
                    Text is read aloud using a single ARIA live region, whose text is changed to respond to the users key events and
                    to describe the initial scene. Even though it has
                    only been tested on a few browsers, we expect this version to work well on many browsers. While it
                    provides keyboard support, display of focus regions and text readout, the elements are not exposed to assistive
                    technology
                    so some features such as zooming in on the focused element or using a keyboard shortcut to navigate to the next
                    checkbox
                    are not available.

                <td>
                    This prototype is rendered using SVG and uses ARIA markup to present the elements to assistive technology.  Text is provided by "aria-label"
                    and all elements are exposed as role="button".  This version works on OS X Chrome + OS X Safari.  Firefox 36.0.4 does not
                    work but a nightly build of Firefox does work.  When using NVDA on windows, it must be put into "Forms Mode" before
                    interaction with the sim is possible.  Windows + Chrome + NVDA (in forms mode) works ok.  Other Windows browsers and
                    screen readers have not been tested.  This version exhibits significant differences on different browsers, but provides support
                    for zooming and other screen reader features.

        <h2>Sonification Prototypes</h2>

        <p>Below are links to prototypes of PhET simulations that include sonification, i.e. the use of non-speech sounds to
            convey meaning.</p>

        <p>Note: As of February 2015, these prototypes have only been tested in the Chrome browser.</p>
