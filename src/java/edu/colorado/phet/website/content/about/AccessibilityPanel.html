        <!--<h2>Accessibility Prototypes</h2>-->

        <p>The PhET Interactive Simulations project is actively engaged in efforts to increase the accessibility of interactive simulations for
            diverse students, including students with disabilities. As part of this work we have developed prototypes of PhET simulations with
            preliminary implementations of accessibility features. As you explore these prototypes, please make note of the specific browser and
            assistive technology they were tested with.</p>

        <h2>Keyboard Navigation and Auditory Description Prototypes</h2>

        <p>PhET simulations are rendered using SVG or Canvas (with future WebGL support planned), which makes it impossible to use
            conventional DOM-based approaches for accessibility. Below are prototypes of simulations containing implementations of keyboard
            navigation (allowing interactions without the use of a mouse or touch interface) and auditory descriptions (for screen readers).<br/>
            Note: These prototypes are known to have many issues and are not intended for broad usage.
        </p>

        <h3>Forces and Motion: Basics (Net Force Screen) - Custom Support</h3>

        <p>
            <i>Rendered with SVG. Uses global key listeners to provide custom keyboard accessibility support</i><br/>
            <b>Implementation:</b> Focused elements are managed using custom data structures and the focus rectangle is drawn in SVG.
            Text is read aloud using a single ARIA live region, whose text is changed to respond to the users key events and
            to describe the initial scene.<br/>
            <b>Browser Compatibility:</b> Even though it has only been tested on a few browsers, we expect this version to work well on many
            browsers.<br/>
            <b>Limitations:</b> While it provides keyboard support, display of focus regions, and text readout, the elements are not exposed to
            assistive technology so some features (such as zooming) or changes based on user preferences/customizations are not available.<br/>

        </p>

        <h3>Forces and Motion: Basics (Net Force Screen) - ARIA Support on SVG Elements</h3>

        <p>
            <i>Rendered with SVG. Uses ARIA markup to present the elements to assistive technology</i><br/>
            <b>Implementation:</b> Text is provided by "aria-label" and all elements are exposed as role="button"<br/>
            <b>Browser Compatibility:</b> This version works on OS X Chrome + OS X Safari, and a nightly build of Firefox (does not work with Firefox
            36.0.4). Windows + Chrome + NVDA (in forms mode) works ok. Other Windows browsers and screen readers have not been tested.<br/>
            <b>Limitations:</b> This version exhibits significant differences on different browsers, but provides support for zooming and user
            preferences/customizations.<br/>

        <h2>Sonification Prototypes</h2>

        <p>Below are links to prototypes of PhET simulations that include sonification, i.e. the use of non-speech sounds to
            convey meaning.</p>

        <p>Note: As of February 2015, these prototypes have only been tested in the Chrome browser.</p>
