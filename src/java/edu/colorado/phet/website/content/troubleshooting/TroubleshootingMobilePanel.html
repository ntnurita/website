        The original PhET Java sims cannot run on Chromebooks, tablets like iPad or Android, or mobile phones. This is due to
        their lack of support for Java. To resolve this problem we are re-programming the simulations to HTML5, which is
        compatible with tablet devices, Chromebooks, and PC's.

        The HTML5 interface is entirely web-based and will be easily embedded into any type of software that embeds HTML5 code.

        Our plan is to port most of the sims eventually to HTML5, but there are likely some less popular sims that will not be ported. It may be
        several years before the majority of PhET sims are converted to HTML5 (we have been publishing ~1 sim per month). This is because porting the
        sims to HTML5 is very expensive for us - it basically involves redesigning the sim for touch, rewriting all of the sim and model code, then
        testing on an array of devices.

        These next-generation simulations will not only be touch and tablet optimized but will also eventually include additional
        improvements such as enhanced data input-output capabilities to support 3rd party customization.
