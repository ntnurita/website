        When I run simulations from the PhET Offline Website Installer, I am seeing a dialog that says
        "The application's digital signature has been verified. Do you want to run the application?"
        (or something similar). What does this mean?
      </wicket:message>
    </h3></a>

    <div wicket:id="troubleshooting-mac-q1-answer" class="answer" id="q1">
      <p>
        The PhET simulations that are distributed with the installer include a "digital certificate" that verifies that
        these simulations were actually created by PhET. This is a security measure that helps to prevent an unscrupulous
        individual from creating applications that claim to be produced by PhET but are not. If the certificate acceptance
        dialog says that the publisher is "PhET, University of Colorado", and the dialog also says that the signature was
        validated by a trusted source, you can have a high degree of confidence that the application was produced by the
        PhET team.
      </p>

      <p>
        On most systems, it is possible to permanently accept the PhET certificate and thereby prevent this dialog from
        appearing each time a simulation is run locally. Most Windows and Max OSX systems have a check box on the certificate
        acceptance dialog that says "Always trust content from this publisher". Checking this box will configure your system
        in such a way that the dialog will no longer appear when starting up PhET simulations.

        This problem will affect mac users who recently installed Apple's "Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 4". The update will
        typically be done via Software Update, or automatically. After installing this update, the problem appears: clicking
        on JNLP files in Safari or FireFox caused the JNLP file to open in TextEdit, instead of starting Java Web Start.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fix is:<br/>
        1. Go to <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/Java_for_Mac_OS_X_10_5_Update_4">http://support.apple.com/downloads/Java_for_Mac_OS_X_10_5_Update_4</a><br/>
        2. Click Download to download a .dmg file<br/>
        3. When the .dmg has downloaded, double-click on it (if it doesn't mount automatically)<br/>
        4. Quit all applications<br/>
        5. Run the update installer

        If a simulation that uses 3D graphics is not launching or displaying correctly, updating your video card's
        drivers may fix the issue.

      <p>
        Updating the video card driver can be done through the normal software update process (Available from the Apple menu

          It shows up on ALL Mac OS X 10.8, many 10.6 and 10.7 computers.

        <p>
          Unfortunately, at this time the incompatibility problem is out of our hands and unless Oracle or Apple address this
          issue, it is unlikely the sim will run successfully.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are hoping incompatibilities like this will be a thing of the past once we move most of our sims to HTML5.

        Gatekeeper, introduced in Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8), is designed to prevent potentially malicious apps from launching.
        When you attempt to launch an app that doesn't meet certain criteria, Gatekeeper will block the launch. To override this,
        you can modify Gatekeeper's default settings (but we don't always recommend it), or explicitly right/control-click the
        application and choose Open.
      </p>

      <p>
        1. Download the .jar file for each sim you would like to use. (Or download all of them)<br/>
        2. In Finder, Control-click or right click the icon of the sim.<br/>
        3. Select Open from the top of contextual menu that appears.<br/>
        4. Click Open in the dialog box. If prompted, enter an administrator name and password.<br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        The other option is to go into preferences and change the security settings:
        System Preferences>Security and Privacy>General> Change 'Allow applications downloaded from' to "Anywhere"> Accept prompt "Allow From
        Anywhere"
        We don't advise this because it disables Gatekeeper. It is generally safer to maintain Gatekeeper and individually open the files.

        In order to open a '.jnlp' file (the type of file used for “run now”), you will need to use Java Web Start. Java Web Start is part of
        the default Java installation.

        When you are prompted with the dialog asking for the app to use to open the file, click "Choose program", your finder window should
        open. Press Cmd-Shift-G to open the go to folder. Paste this folder: /System/Library/CoreServices
        This is where Java Web Start should be located on default mac installation. There should be an executable called 'Java-Web-Start'.
        Select this app.
