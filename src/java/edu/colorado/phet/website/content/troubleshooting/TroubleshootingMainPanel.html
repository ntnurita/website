      <p>The original sims are programmed in Java or Flash. Flash is installed in most modern desktop web browsers while Java is a free application that can be downloaded from Oracle. To run the Java-based simulations you must have Java version 1.5 or higher installed on your computer.
        To download the latest version of Java, please visit: <a href="https://www.java.com/">https://www.java.com</a></p>.

      <p>It has come to our attention that some of our users are unable to use our Flash-based simulations due to
        a
        compatibility issue between Apple Computer's QuickTime&trade; and the Flash&trade; player. Some users
        have
        reported that uninstalling QuickTime resolves the issue.

      <p>We are aware that this is not an acceptable solution and are working to resolve this issue. If you are

        Why do PhET simulations run slower on my laptop than on a desktop?
      </wicket:message>
    </h3></a>

    <div class="answer" id="q8" wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q8-answer">
      <p>On some laptop computers, simulations may appear to run much slower than anticipated and/or exhibit
        unexpected
        graphics problems. This may be due to power management settings that affect how the computer's graphics
        system
        runs and can be corrected by either a) changing the computer's power management configuration, or b)
        using the
        laptop computer while plugged in to an AC power source.</p>

      <p>Many laptop computers are configured to reduce the amount of battery power used by the graphics/video
        system
        while the computer is running on battery power. If you must use the laptop while it is not plugged in,
        we
        suggest changing your computer's power management settings to "maximize performance" while unplugged.
        This
        should ensure that the graphics system runs at its peak speed. The location of this setting varies from
        one
        manufacturer to the next and we suggest contacting your computer vendor if you have difficulty locating
        it.
        Please contact us at <a href="mailto:phethelp@colorado.edu?Subject=Laptop%20Performance%20Issues">phethelp@colorado.edu</a>

    <div class="answer" id="q9" wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q9-answer">
      <p>Simulations that use sound can be unstable when run on computers using old device driver software. If you
        are
        encountering crashes or other undesirable behavior with any of our simulations that use sound, we advise
        updating your sound drivers, as this may solve the problem. For assistance with updating your sound
        drivers,
        contact your computer vendor or audio hardware manufacturer. Contact us at
        <a href="mailto:phethelp@colorado.edu?Subject=Sound%20Issues">phethelp@colorado.edu</a> if you continue

        I have downloaded and installed the PhET Offline Website Installer, and I get a warning on every page.
        Why?
      </wicket:message>
    </h3></a>

    <div class="answer" id="q11" wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q11-answer">
      <p>The <a href="#">PhET Offline Website Installer</a> creates a local copy of the
        current
        version of the PhET website on your computer. When you access this locally installed copy, your computer
        will
        use your default browser, which for many people is Internet Explorer. If the security settings are set
        to their
        default values, you may get an error that says <em>"To help protect your security, Internet Explorer has
          restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls that could access your computer.
          Click here
          for options..."</em> (or something similar). This is a security feature of Internet Explorer version
        6 and
        later, and is meant to warn users about running active content locally. The PhET simulations present no
        danger
        to your computer, and running them locally is no different than running them from the web site.
      </p>

      <p>If you wish to disable this warning, you can do so by adjusting your browser's security settings. For IE
        versions
        6 and 7, the way to do this is to go into Tools->Internet Options->Advanced, find the "Security"
        heading, and
        check "Allow active content to run in files on My Computer". Note that you will need to restart Internet
        Explorer to get this change to take effect. You should only do this if feel confident that there is no
        other
        off-line content that you may run on your computer that could be malicious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, you could use a different browser (such as Firefox) that does not have this issue.

      <wicket:message key="troubleshooting.main.q12.title">
        When I run simulations from the PhET Offline Website Installer, I am seeing a dialog that says "The
        application's digital signature has been verified. Do you want to run the application?" (or something
        similar).
        What does this mean?
      </wicket:message>
    </h3></a>

    <div class="answer" id="q12" wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q12-answer">
      <p>The PhET simulations that are distributed with the installer include a "digital certificate" that
        verifies that
        these simulations were actually created by PhET. This is a security measure that helps to prevent an
        unscrupulous individual from creating applications that claim to be produced by PhET but are not. If the
        certificate acceptance dialog says that the publisher is "PhET, University of Colorado", and the dialog
        also
        says that the signature was validated by a trusted source, you can have a high degree of confidence that
        the
        application was produced by the PhET team.</p>

      <p>On most systems, it is possible to permanently accept the PhET certificate and thereby prevent this
        dialog from
        appearing each time a simulation is run locally. Most Windows and Max OSX systems have a check box on
        the
        certificate acceptance dialog that says "Always trust content from this publisher". Checking this box
        will
        configure your system in such a way that the dialog will no longer appear when starting up PhET
        simulations.</p>
